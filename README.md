# Video tutorial: DM @roiuki on discord for vid

## How To Install/Use
## 1 INSTALL Netlimiter Release 4.1.13.0 from this offical website link: https://www.netlimiter.com/releases/4-1-13-0
## 2 Once fully installed just hit finish and open zkxxx.exe, IF IT SAYS "*BLANK* service is not running" simply hit start
(if did a fresh install of Netlimiter NLSVC is already running by default)
(If it doesnt auto direct you to the basic netlimiter screen then just restart the program)
## 3 setup your filters in "Filter List" and once filters are set-up with rules for example (3074 1 B/s) go into Rule List and right click the one you want and set a hotkey.

## Filters

## Ports (If you don't know how they work just look up netlimiter destiny 2 and you'll find videos on it)
